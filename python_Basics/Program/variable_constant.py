# 5. Variable and Constant in Python
# Variable :
# A variable is like a container or label that stores a value which can change over time.
a = 3
age = 15

# Real-life example:
# Your age
# Today it is 18, next year it will be 19

# Constant:
# A constant is a value that never changes.
# Real-life example:

# Number of days in a week → 7
# Value of π (pi) → 3.14159
# Speed of light → fixed
num = 7
value = 3.14159


# Rules for decalaring a Variable:
# value_1 = 20 ===> correct
# 1_val = 2 =====> wrong
# _1hello = 3 ====> wrong
