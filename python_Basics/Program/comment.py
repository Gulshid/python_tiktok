# 6. Comments in Python

# A comment is a line in a program used to explain the
# code, and it is ignored by the compiler/interpreter.


# Why we use comments:
#    We use comments to explain code, make it easy to understand,
#    and help others (or ourselves) read the program later.

# Types of Comment:
# 1. Single Line Comment
# this is single line comment




# 2. Multi Line Comment
