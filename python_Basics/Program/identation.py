# Indentation:
    # Indentation means spaces at the beginning of a line.
    # In Python, indentation is VERY IMPORTANT because it
    # defines blocks of code.

    # 👉 No braces {} like C/C++
    # 👉 Indentation = structure
    
#     Standard Rule

# Use 4 spaces (recommended)

# Do NOT mix tabs and spaces
